#Requirements
In order to use this script, you'll need
1. Python (I tested on 2.7.6 and 3.4)
2. [BeautifulSoup version 4](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/#installing-beautiful-soup)

I believe everything else I use is from the standard library.

#Using the tool
From terminal, simply run
    $ python Roshpit.py
